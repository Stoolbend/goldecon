# goldecon+ - A Simple economy based around gold nuggets

## A little intro
goldecon+ (plus) is a version of boardinggamer's & Kierrow's "goldecon" plugin with
some slight modifications & improvements by Stoolbend <stoolbend@mc-server.co.uk>.
The PLUS version of goldecon contains a load of extra features (previously released
as individual plugin files) which are listed below, but if you just want the basic
