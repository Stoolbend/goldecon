# goldecon-lite - A Simple economy based around gold nuggets

## A little intro
goldecon-lite is a version of boardinggamer's & Kierrow's "goldecon" plugin with
some slight modifications & improvements by Stoolbend <stoolbend@mc-server.co.uk>.
The lite version of goldecon contains just the core functions, thats the ability
to pay people with gold nuggets & receive payments in gold nuggets. I plan to
re-release some improved features to go alongside goldecon-lite so you can select
what modules you want to use with your setup. If you want the full blown package
with all the latest features, then check out the plus branch in the top left corner.
goldecon+ is the fully-featured version of goldecon with plenty of extras included.
